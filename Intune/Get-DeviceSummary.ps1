    Lists all Intune managed devices with key properties.
.DESCRIPTION
    Queries Microsoft Graph for all Intune managed devices and returns a summary
    of each device including hardware details, compliance state, enrollment info,
    and management agent. Useful for inventory audits, onboarding reviews, and
    generating device fleet reports for clients.

    Requires Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement module and
    DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All permission.
.PARAMETER OutputPath
    Optional path to export results as CSV. If not specified, results are returned
    to the pipeline.
.EXAMPLE
    PS> . .\Common\Connect-Service.ps1
    PS> Connect-Service -Service Graph -Scopes 'DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All'
    PS> .\Intune\Get-DeviceSummary.ps1

    Lists all managed devices with key properties including compliance state and hardware info.
.EXAMPLE
    PS> .\Intune\Get-DeviceSummary.ps1 -OutputPath '.\device-summary.csv'

    Exports the full device inventory to CSV for client reporting.
