.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a SOC 2 Common Criteria readiness checklist for items that cannot be automated.
.DESCRIPTION
    Produces a checklist of organizational, procedural, and governance controls required
    by the AICPA SOC 2 Common Criteria (CC1-CC5, CC8-CC9) that apply to every SOC 2
    engagement regardless of which trust principles are selected.

    These controls require documented policies, human attestation, and organizational
    processes that cannot be verified through M365 API queries alone. This checklist
    ensures organizations are aware of all requirements beyond the automated technical
    checks performed by the Security and Confidentiality control scripts.

    Also includes guidance on supplementary evidence that can be sourced from existing
    M365-Assess collectors (Secure Score, App Registrations, Defender policies).

    All operations are strictly read-only — this script generates a static checklist
    and does not query any APIs.

    DISCLAIMER: This tool assists with SOC 2 readiness assessment. It does not
    constitute a SOC 2 audit or certification.
.PARAMETER OutputPath
    Optional path to export checklist as CSV.
.EXAMPLE
    PS> .\SOC2\Get-SOC2ReadinessChecklist.ps1
