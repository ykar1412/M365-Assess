Run a single command to produce a comprehensive set of CSV reports and a branded HTML assessment report covering identity, email, security, devices, collaboration, and compliance baselines. Designed for IT consultants and administrators assessing Microsoft 365 environments.

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Daren9m/M365-Assess.git
cd M365-Assess

# Run the full M365 assessment (interactive wizard launches if no params given)
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1

# Or specify tenant directly
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'

# Results land in a timestamped folder with CSV data + HTML report
Get-ChildItem .\M365-Assessment\Assessment_* -Directory | Sort-Object Name -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
```

## Interactive Console App

Running the orchestrator with no parameters launches a full interactive wizard:

```powershell
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1
```

The console app walks you through four steps:

1. **Select sections** — toggle assessment sections on/off (Tenant, Identity, Email, etc.)
2. **Tenant ID** — enter your tenant ID or `*.onmicrosoft.com` domain
3. **Authentication** — choose Interactive, Certificate-based, or Skip (pre-existing connections)
4. **Output folder** — confirm or change the output directory

        ░▒▓█  by  D A R E N 9 M            █▓▒░
```

During execution, the console displays real-time progress with status indicators for each collector (`✓` complete, `○` skipped, `✗` failed) plus item counts and timing. The completion banner summarizes results and links to the HTML report.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **PowerShell 7.x** (`pwsh`) | Primary runtime. [Install guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) |
| **Windows PowerShell 5.1** | Required only for the ScubaGear section. Ships with Windows. |
| **Microsoft.Graph** | Core Graph module for Entra ID, licensing, Intune, security collectors |
| **ExchangeOnlineManagement** | Exchange Online and Purview collectors |

Install the core modules:

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph, ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope CurrentUser
```

ScubaGear and its 8 dependencies are installed automatically the first time you run that section.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Windows** | Fully tested |
| **macOS** | Experimental |
| **Linux** | Experimental |

M365 Assess is developed and tested on Windows. macOS and Linux are supported by PowerShell 7 but have **not been fully tested** with this tool. The interactive wizard and console output rely on Unicode rendering and terminal features that may behave differently across platforms.

**We'd love help from the community!** If you run into issues on macOS or Linux, please open an issue and include:

1. Your OS and version (e.g., macOS 14.3, Ubuntu 24.04)
2. PowerShell version (`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`)
3. Terminal app (e.g., Terminal.app, iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal)
4. The full error message and stack trace
5. The assessment log file (`_Assessment-Log.txt`) from your output folder, if one was generated

**To submit a bug report:**

```bash
# From the repo, use the GitHub CLI:
gh issue create --title "macOS/Linux: <short description>" --body "..."

# Or open an issue directly at:
# https://github.com/Daren9m/M365-Assess/issues/new
```

Attach your `_Assessment-Log.txt` by dragging it into the GitHub issue, or paste the relevant error output in a code block.

## M365 Assessment Suite

The orchestrator (`Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1`) connects to the required services, dispatches collectors across 8 standard sections, and exports CSV reports plus a branded HTML report into a timestamped folder. All operations are strictly read-only (`Get-*` cmdlets only). Failures in one section do not block others.

### Available Sections

| Section | Collectors | What It Covers |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Tenant** | Tenant Info | Organization profile, verified domains, security defaults |
| **Identity** | User Summary, MFA Report, Admin Roles, Conditional Access, App Registrations, Password Policy, Entra Security Config | User accounts, MFA status, RBAC, CA policies, app registrations, consent settings, password protection |
| **Licensing** | License Summary | SKU allocation and assignment counts |
| **Email** | Mailbox Summary, Mail Flow, Email Security, EXO Security Config, DNS Authentication | Mailbox types, transport rules, anti-spam/phishing, modern auth, audit settings, external sender tagging, SPF/DKIM/DMARC |
| **Intune** | Device Summary, Compliance Policies, Config Profiles | Managed devices, compliance state, configuration profiles |
| **Security** | Secure Score, Improvement Actions, Defender Policies, Defender Security Config, DLP Policies | Microsoft Secure Score, Defender for Office 365, anti-phishing/spam/malware, Safe Links/Attachments, data loss prevention |
| **Collaboration** | SharePoint & OneDrive, SharePoint Security Config, Teams Access, Teams Security Config | Sharing settings, external sharing controls, sync restrictions, Teams meeting policies, third-party app restrictions |
| **Hybrid** | Hybrid Sync | Azure AD Connect sync status and domain configuration |
| **Inventory** *(opt-in)* | Mailbox Inventory, Group Inventory, Teams Inventory, SharePoint Inventory, OneDrive Inventory | Per-object M&A inventory: all mailboxes (user/shared/room/equipment), distribution lists, M365 groups, Teams with owners and channels, SharePoint sites with storage, OneDrive accounts with usage |
| **ScubaGear** *(opt-in)* | CISA Baseline Scan | CISA SCuBA security baseline compliance (see below) |

### Running Specific Sections

```powershell
# Run only Identity and Email
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section Identity,Email -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'

# Run only M&A Inventory (opt-in)
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section Inventory -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'

# Run everything including ScubaGear (opt-in)
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section Tenant,Identity,Licensing,Email,Intune,Security,Collaboration,Hybrid,ScubaGear -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

### Multi-Framework Compliance

The HTML report includes a **Compliance Overview** section that maps all assessed security controls across 12 compliance frameworks simultaneously. No parameters needed — all framework data is always included.

Supported frameworks:

| Framework | Controls | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| CIS M365 E3 Level 1 | 86 | CIS Benchmark v6.0.1 — compliance score |
| CIS M365 E3 Level 2 | 34 | CIS Benchmark v6.0.1 — compliance score |
| CIS M365 E5 Level 1 | 97 | CIS Benchmark v6.0.1 — compliance score |
| CIS M365 E5 Level 2 | 43 | CIS Benchmark v6.0.1 — compliance score |
| NIST 800-53 Rev 5 | 1,189 | Coverage mapping |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | 106 | Coverage mapping |
| ISO 27001:2022 | 93 | Coverage mapping |
| DISA STIG | 148 | Coverage mapping |
| PCI DSS v4.0.1 | 64 | Coverage mapping |
| CMMC 2.0 | 110 | Coverage mapping |
| HIPAA Security Rule | 45 | Coverage mapping |
| CISA SCuBA | 80 | Coverage mapping |

The report's Compliance Overview provides:
- **Framework selector** — checkbox controls to toggle which frameworks are visible (all on by default)
- **Coverage cards** — CIS profiles show compliance score (pass rate); other frameworks show mapped control coverage
- **Status filter** — filter findings by Pass, Fail, Warning, or Review status
- **Cross-reference matrix** — every assessed finding with columns for each framework's mapped controls

Edit `Common/framework-mappings.csv` to customize control mappings across frameworks.

    _Assessment-Issues.log            # Issue report with recommendations
    _Assessment-Report.html           # Branded HTML report
```

Start with `_Assessment-Report.html` for a presentation-ready overview, or `_Assessment-Summary.csv` for programmatic access.

### Authentication

**Interactive (default)** — a browser window opens for each service:

```powershell
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

**Interactive with UPN** — avoids WAM broker errors on some systems:

```powershell
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -UserPrincipalName 'admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

**Certificate-based app-only** — for unattended or scheduled runs:

```powershell
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' `
    -ClientId '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' `
    -CertificateThumbprint 'ABC123DEF456'
```

**Pre-existing connections** — if you already ran `Connect-MgGraph` and `Connect-ExchangeOnline`:

```powershell
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -SkipConnection
```

### Console Output

The orchestrator provides real-time console feedback during execution:

- **Progress table** — shows each collector's status, item count, and duration as it runs
- **Pre-flight checks** — validates module versions and permissions before connecting
- **Issue summary** — logs errors and warnings with recommended actions
- **Completion banner** — links to the output folder and HTML report

All console output is also written to `_Assessment-Log.txt` for reference.

### HTML Report

The assessment automatically generates a self-contained HTML report (`_Assessment-Report.html`) that can be emailed directly to clients — no external dependencies, no assets folder needed. All logos are base64-encoded, styles and scripts are embedded inline.

**Report features:**

- **Light / Dark mode** — floating toggle button with automatic detection via `prefers-color-scheme`, persisted to `localStorage`. Every element is themed — badges, framework tags, stat cards, table headers, and compliance rows all adapt
- **Cover page** with M365 Assess branding and tenant name
- **Organization profile card** — non-collapsible header showing org name, primary domain, creation date, and security defaults status
- **Executive summary** with section/collector stat cards and issue overview
- **Identity KPIs** — stat cards for total users, licensed users, MFA adoption %, SSPR enrollment %, and guest user count (MFA/SSPR exclude non-capable accounts from the denominator)
- **Section-by-section data tables** with executive descriptions explaining what each area covers and why it matters
- **Collapsible sub-sections** — detail tables fold under expandable headings with row counts, keeping the report scannable
- **Sortable column headers** — click any column header to sort ascending/descending
- **Compliance Overview** — unified security pane with interactive framework selector, status filter, coverage cards for all 12 frameworks (4 CIS profiles by license/level, NIST 800-53, NIST CSF, ISO 27001, DISA STIG, PCI DSS, CMMC, HIPAA, CISA SCuBA), and cross-reference matrix table
- **Security config highlighting** — Entra, EXO, Defender, SharePoint, and Teams security config tables show color-coded status badges (Pass/Fail/Warning/Review) with row-level tinting
- **Microsoft Secure Score** — visual stat cards and progress bar showing current score, points earned, and comparison to the M365 global average
- **Issues & recommendations** with severity badges and remediation guidance
- **Accessibility** — semantic HTML landmarks (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), `scope="col"` on all table headers, focus-visible outlines
- **Print-friendly styling** — open in any browser and print to PDF with automatic page breaks and repeated table headers

The report generator can also be run standalone to regenerate the HTML from existing CSV data without re-running the assessment:

```powershell
.\Common\Export-AssessmentReport.ps1 -AssessmentFolder '.\M365-Assessment\Assessment_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS'
```

### Custom Branding

To use your own logo and background in the HTML report, place your images in `Common/assets/`:

| File | Purpose | Format | Recommended Size |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `m365-assess-logo.png` | Report cover page logo | PNG | 400 x 120 px |
| `m365-assess-logo-white.png` | Light-on-dark variant (optional) | PNG | 400 x 120 px |
| `m365-assess-bg.png` | Cover page background | PNG | 1200 x 800 px |

The report engine base64-encodes these images into the HTML at generation time, so the output file is fully self-contained. Simply replace the files with your own branding and re-run the report generator.

## ScubaGear Integration (CISA Baseline Compliance)

[CISA ScubaGear](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear) assesses your M365 tenant against the Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) security baselines. It is included as an **opt-in** section because it requires Windows PowerShell 5.1, handles its own authentication, and takes several minutes to complete.

**How it works**: The orchestrator transparently shells out to `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) to run ScubaGear. You stay in PowerShell 7 — the version bridging is handled automatically.

**First run**: ScubaGear and all 8 of its dependencies (OPA, Microsoft.Graph.Authentication, ExchangeOnlineManagement, SharePoint PnP, Teams, PowerApps, etc.) are auto-installed via `Initialize-SCuBA`. This may take 5-10 minutes. Subsequent runs are faster.

**Products scanned** (all 7 by default): Entra ID, Defender, Exchange Online, Power Platform, Power BI, SharePoint, Teams.

```powershell
# Run ScubaGear scan only
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section ScubaGear -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'

# Combine with other sections
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section Tenant,Identity,ScubaGear -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'

# Scan specific products
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section ScubaGear -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -ScubaProductNames aad,exo

# Government tenant (GCC)
.\Invoke-M365Assessment.ps1 -Section ScubaGear -TenantId 'contoso.onmicrosoft.us' -M365Environment gcc
```

ScubaGear produces native HTML and JSON reports in the `ScubaGear-Report/` subfolder alongside the parsed `23-ScubaGear-Baseline.csv`.

## Individual Scripts

Every collector can also be run standalone outside the orchestrator:

```powershell
# Connect to the required service first
. .\Common\Connect-Service.ps1
Connect-Service -Service Graph -Scopes 'User.Read.All','UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All'

# Run a single collector
.\Entra\Get-MfaReport.ps1

# Export directly to CSV
.\Entra\Get-MfaReport.ps1 -OutputPath '.\mfa-report.csv'
```
